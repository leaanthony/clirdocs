#### Why did you write this?

Because other libraries did not easily do what I wanted. They were also pretty heavyweight and I wanted lean 'n' mean.

#### What does Cl√Ær mean?

It's the [Welsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_language) word for "Clear". It sounds almost identical but it's Cleeeer rather than Clee-ur.

#### Will you support feature X?

Probably not.

#### What about double dashes?

Probably not.

#### Why not?

Stability and Simplicity.
